# CapstoneAnnthea
Our team came up with the idea of developing an acne problem machine
learning app aer realizing the challenges associated with acne detection. Many of us have
personally struggled with acne and have found the process of identifying eective
treatment options to be overwhelming.
We are inspired to leverage the application of machine learning algorithms
to help identify the severity of acne on the face and provide specic and personalized
skincare recommendations.
The campaign for the application aims to create a safe space for people to
share their experiences of overcoming acne. Users can share their journey by posting
photos and stories, and the plaorm will have a toxic words block feature to prevent
negative comments. Users will be incentivized with reward points that can be redeemed for
skincare product discounts and other rewards. The goal is to encourage more people to
use the plaorm and create a suppoive community for those struggling with acne.

# Project Scope & Deliverables:
In this project we want to create an acne detection app that detect the severity
of acne (level 0-2) and gave skincare recommendation to treat them. The app also can
predict estimate time needed to treat the acne using recommended product. Our app will
have some features such as : Image recognition using phone camera to detect acne,
actives recommendation to treat acne based on their severity, forecast about the time
needed to treat the acne, forum with reward system where user can share their journey
and gave each other feedback, user can get reward based on their activity in the forum.
Based on our path, to create this project we will need to :
Machine Learning Students
- Collecting Dataset
- Preprocessing Data
- Creating Image Processing Model and Training
- Creating Recommendation System Model and Training
- Creating Predictive Analytics Model and Training
- Integrating to Android Application
- Project Initiation
Cloud Computing Students
- Seing Up GCP Services, Creating Viual Machines, Conguring network and
security seings.
- Creating RESTfull API.
- Deploy to GCP Environment, Testing and Validation.
- Monitoring and Maintanance, Peorm maintanance and troubleshooting.
Project Plan for Bangkit 2023 Product-based Capstone
- Project Initiation
Mobile Development Students
- Design UI & UX Model
- Develop UI application with kotlin
- Developing application logic, API request, etc
- Testing and Maintanance
- Fixing the App problems
- Project Initiation
Project Peormance/Monitoring
- Project Objectives
- Schedule Checker
- Project Accuration
- Final Presentation Submission
Here are a few constraints of our acne detection app:
- It needs to be live one day before our nal submission deadline (June 15, 2023)
- Our data might not accurately reect the actual severity level of acne because it
hasn't been validated by expeise in the dermatologist area.
- We don't add chat bot consultation feature because it will take a lot of time to
create a chatbot with high accuracy answer
